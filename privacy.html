      <h2 id="reg">1. Regulatory Compliance</h2>
      <p>We comply with applicable data protection laws in all jurisdictions where we operate, using the GDPR as a reference standard to ensure best practices. This includes, but is not limited to, El Salvador’s data protection laws, AML/CTF regulations, and specific regulations in regions where TFG or its subsidiaries provide services. We adapt to stricter local requirements when applicable, ensuring the protection of your Personal Information across all our global operations.</p>

      <h2 id="collect">2. Personal Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>We collect Personal Information to provide, maintain, and improve our Services. Personal Information is any data that directly or indirectly identifies a living individual.</p>

      <h3>2.1 Information Provided Directly</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Account and Identification Data:</strong> Name, email address, phone number, date of birth, official identification (e.g., passport, driver’s license), proof of address, and tax identification numbers for KYC/AML compliance.</li>

        <li><strong>Communication Data:</strong> Information in emails, chats, or forms sent to us.</li>
        <li><strong>Business Information:</strong> For corporate users, company name, registration details, beneficial owner information, and corporate documents.</li>

        <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> Approximate location based on IP address or device settings (with consent where required).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2.3 Information from Third Parties</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Data from KYC/AML service providers (e.g., ComplyAdvantage), blockchain analysis tools (e.g., Chainalysis), or public sources for verification.</li>
        <li>References from partners or affiliates.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2.4 Special Category Data</h3>
      <p>We do not collect Special Category Data (e.g., racial or ethnic origins, political opinions, health data, biometric data, or criminal records) except in exceptional cases required for regulatory compliance, such as advanced KYC/AML verifications. Such data is processed with enhanced security measures, including high-level encryption and restricted access, and only with a valid legal basis, such as explicit consent or a regulatory obligation.</p>

      <h2 id="use">3. How We Use Your Personal Information</h2>
      <p>We use your Personal Information for legitimate business purposes, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Service Provision:</strong> Processing loans, verifying identity for KYC/AML, executing transactions, and managing accounts.</li>
        <li><strong>Compliance and Risk Management:</strong> Conducting due diligence, monitoring for fraud, money laundering, or terrorism financing, and reporting to regulators (e.g., CNAD/UIF in El Salvador).</li>
        <li><strong>Service Improvement:</strong> Analyzing usage patterns to enhance platforms, develop new features, and personalize experiences. When using aggregated or anonymized data for analytics or reporting, we apply robust anonymization techniques to ensure it cannot be linked to an individual.</li>
        <li><strong>Communications:</strong> Sending service updates, security alerts, marketing (with opt-out options), and regulatory notifications.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal Obligations:</strong> Responding to subpoenas, audits, or requests from authorities.</li>
        <li><strong>Analytics and Research:</strong> Using aggregated and anonymized data for internal reports or industry insights.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Legal bases for processing (under GDPR):</strong> consent; performance of a contract; legal obligations; legitimate interests (e.g., fraud prevention).</p>

      <h2 id="share">4. Sharing Your Personal Information</h2>
      <p>We do not sell your Personal Information. We share it only when necessary:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> Third-party providers for hosting, KYC/AML verification (e.g., ComplyAdvantage), transaction monitoring (e.g., Chainalysis), and payment processing. These providers are contractually obligated to protect the data.</li>
        <li><strong>Subsidiaries and Affiliates:</strong> Within the Group (e.g., Turing Payments) for integrated services.</li>
        <li><strong>Regulators and Authorities:</strong> To comply with laws, including sharing with authorities in El Salvador or international bodies for AML/CTF reporting.</li>
        <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> In mergers, acquisitions, or asset sales, with notification where required.</li>
        <li><strong>With Consent:</strong> For marketing partners or as permitted.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We ensure recipients comply with appropriate safeguards, such as standard contractual clauses for international transfers.</p>

      <h2 id="security">5. Data Security</h2>
      <p>We implement robust security measures to protect your Personal Information, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Encryption of data in transit and at rest.</li>
        <li>Access controls (e.g., multi-factor authentication, role-based permissions).</li>
        <li>Regular audits, penetration testing, and breach monitoring.</li>
        <li>Compliance with ISO 27001 standards and blockchain best practices for custody and transactions.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Despite these measures, no system is infallible. In case of a security breach, we will notify affected users and regulators within legal deadlines (e.g., 72 hours under GDPR).</p>

      <h2 id="retention">6. Data Retention</h2>
      <h3>6.1 Retention Periods</h3>
      <p>We retain your Personal Information only for as long as necessary for the stated purposes or to comply with legal requirements:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Account Data:</strong> During the duration of your relationship with us plus 7 years after termination (for AML records).</li>
        <li><strong>Transaction Data:</strong> Indefinitely for blockchain immutability, with personal identifiers anonymized where possible.</li>
        <li><strong>Logs:</strong> Up to 2 years for security purposes.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Data is securely deleted or anonymized at the end of retention periods.</p>

      <h3>6.2 Data on Blockchain</h3>
      <p>Due to the immutable nature of blockchains, certain transaction data may remain in public records. To comply with Data Subject rights, such as the right to erasure, we anonymize personal identifiers to the extent possible and manage sensitive data off-chain when necessary.</p>

      <h2 id="rights">7. Your Rights and Options</h2>
      <h3>7.1 Data Subject Rights</h3>
      <p>Depending on your location, you may have the following rights over your Personal Information under the GDPR and other applicable laws:</p>

        <li><strong>Objection:</strong> Object to processing based on legitimate interests or direct marketing.</li>

      <h2 id="transfers">9. International Data Transfers</h2>
      <p>As a global group headquartered in El Salvador, we transfer data to countries such as affiliates in the European Union and South America. Before transferring Personal Information outside the European Economic Area (EEA), we conduct Transfer Impact Assessments (TIAs) to ensure that safeguards, such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) or Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs), are adequate and comply with legal requirements, especially in jurisdictions without adequacy decisions.</p>
      <p>Transfers may occur without safeguards in exceptional cases, such as with explicit consent, to perform a contract, or for legal claims, subject to approval by the Data Protection Officer.</p>

      <h2 id="children">10. Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p>Our Services are not directed to individuals under 18 years of age. We implement age verification in our forms and registration processes to prevent the collection of data from minors. If we discover that we have collected data from a minor, we delete it immediately. Parents or legal guardians may contact us at <a href="mailto:dataprotection@turingfig.com">dataprotection@turingfig.com</a> to request access, rectification, or deletion of a minor’s data.</p>

      <h2 id="links">11. Third-Party Links and Services</h2>

      <h2 id="changes">12. Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this Policy to reflect changes in our practices, operations, or applicable laws. We will notify you of significant changes by email or through a prominent notice on our website (<a href="https://www.turingfig.com" target="_blank">www.turingfig.com</a>) at least 30 days before they take effect. If you disagree with the changes, you may choose not to use our Services. Continued use after the effective date implies acceptance of the updated Policy.</p>
